# Introduction

Ahadu is a python tool that generates a password list for brute force attempts based on list of words provided. The list is generated by combining the words in different ways and adding common password strengthening techniques.  

# What does it do?

The tool generates a password list file based on the input provided. The tool generates a one, two and three word combinations of the input. It manipulates the input words in a way people try to make them harder to guess. This includes
- Different letter cases
- Replacing some letters with characters and numbers
- Adding numbers and characters at the end
